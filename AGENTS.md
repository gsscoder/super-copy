# AI guidance

## Project Brief
A file distribution utility for deploying assets from registered sources to registered destinations
Supports post-deploy transformation modules for asset-specific customization — such as Claude Code
agents, dotfiles, or config files.
Requirements:
- Scriptable and composable
- Extensible via installable modules
- Designed for single-user, local workflows

## Core Technologies
Node.js, Commander, Conf, simple-git, Chalk

## Memory
The development documents are organized in the `memory-bank` dir:
- `detailed-spec`: primarily focuses on specific feature implementation details
- `gen-directives`: content and code generation guidelines

## Output
- Code: match the architectural and stylistic conventions of the existing codebase
- Quality: production-grade — every line will be reviewed
- Markdown: compact, no linting compliance, formatting identical to this file

## Operational Rules:
- Read a language-specific file in `gen-directives` only when a coding task is requested
- Read files in `detailed-spec` only when required by the current task; scan filenames first and read file contents only if they are relevant to the task
- NEVER update this file
- NEVER modify `*.md` files in `memory-bank` (at any depth in the dir tree) without an explicit request
- NEVER initiate any codebase modifications without an explicit request
- NEVER commit changes to Git history without explicit authorization

### Before Implementing — Reason First
- Surface Uncertainty, Don't Guess Through It: When requirements are ambiguous, contradictory, or incomplete, stop and ask instead of assuming intent and proceeding silently. State assumptions explicitly; if multiple readings are viable, present them rather than picking one silently. Resolve intent up front — this is what makes autonomous execution safe afterward
- Plan Before Implementing: For non-trivial tasks, outline a brief approach before writing code so wrong directions surface early. For multi-step work, list the steps with a verification check for each

### Design & Scope — Code Minimally
- Simplicity Over Abstraction: Write the simplest solution that meets the requirements. Avoid speculative features, abstractions for single-use code, unrequested configurability, and error handling for impossible cases. If a construction could be materially shorter without losing correctness, rewrite it — ask whether a senior engineer would call it overcomplicated
- Surgical Scope: Every changed line should trace directly to the current task. Match the surrounding style even where you'd choose differently. Remove imports, variables, and comments that *your* changes made obsolete, but never modify, reformat, or delete code or comments orthogonal to the task. If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it

### Execution — Verify Against Goals
- Drive Toward Success Criteria: Turn the task into checkable goals and work until they're met — e.g. "add validation" → write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass; "fix the bug" → write a failing test that reproduces it, then make it pass. When the goal is well-defined, loop and self-verify independently rather than pausing for confirmation the criteria already answer. (This is the counterpart to *Surface Uncertainty*: clarify the goal before starting; do not re-open a settled goal mid-execution)
